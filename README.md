# sha2-hashes
Fast SHA-2 hashing in x86 assembly, based on code by [Nayuki](https://github.com/nayuki).

## Benchmarks
Working on it.

## Credits
It makes no sense at all for me to reinvent the wheel here, so the compression function in x86-64 assembly is taken from [here](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-sha2-hashes-in-x86-assembly). I'm upset that no wrapper was given for hashing files (the wrapper given is a benchmark wrapper), which is why this repository exists.
